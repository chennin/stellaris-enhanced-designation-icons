# Enhanced Designation Icons [![Get it from the Workshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/steam-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=steam&logoColor=white)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941285632)

This mod replaces planetary designation icons with their vanilla resource icons, and enhances some to make them stand out more.

* Generator, urban, unification, etc icons are replaced with their resource
* Vanilla prison, fortress, etc icons are given a more prominent edge and/or brightened
* Habitat resource icons are bigger

No art was done during the making of this mod.

# Building

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Pillow (python3-pil) 8.3+
* The game files (this mod uses only game assets to make its graphics). If you're running this, replace the paths at the top of `designationicons.py`.

## Compression

~~Can be done with ImageMagick: `mogrify colony_type.dds -compress dxt5`~~

In 3.7, the image got wider and now compressing makes the replacement look bad, and I don't know DDS well enough to know why. The asset is uncompressed in vanilla [3.6] anyway.
